## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Participants resist creating checklist ("It's extra work")
**Solution:**
- Emphasize: "Planning saves time by preventing false starts"
- Show example of getting lost without plan
- Frame as professional practice, not workshop busy-work
- After Challenge 5, ask: "Did the checklist help? Keep going?"

### Issue: Checklist creation takes too long (>5 min)
**Solution:**
- Interrupt and provide template
- "Use this basic structure, customize later"
- Emphasize: "Good enough > perfect"
- Set timer: "5 minutes for checklist, then start implementing"

### Issue: Participants not following checklist after creating it
**Solution:**
- Check in: "What's next on your checklist?"
- Remind: "Reference your checklist to stay focused"
- Point: "That's not in your checklist - stay on plan"

### Issue: Participants not marking tasks complete
**Solution:**
- Demonstrate: "Here's how - change [ ] to [x]"
- Or: "Ask Claude to mark task X complete"
- Emphasize satisfaction of checking off tasks
- Make it visible: "Raise hand when you complete a section"

### Issue: Time running short in Challenge 6
**Solution:**
- Prioritize: "Get entity, repository, service done. Tests if time"
- Provide solution code for participants to reference
- Focus on learning over completion
- Emphasize: "You have materials to finish later"

## Facilitator Quick Reference

### Key Messages to Reinforce

**Before Challenge 5:**
- "Task-based design is like creating a roadmap with Claude"
- "You'll practice this twice today - simple then advanced"
- "It's a professional skill, not just a workshop exercise"

**During Challenge 5:**
- "Create checklist BEFORE you start refactoring"
- "Mark tasks complete as you finish them"
- "Reference checklist to stay focused"

**During Challenge 6:**
- "Create detailed checklist WITH Claude collaboratively"
- "Work through checklist systematically"
- "Track progress actively - check off tasks"
- "This is how you'll work on real projects"

### Watch For (Circulation Notes)

**Good Signs:**
- Participants referencing checklist frequently
- Marking tasks complete as they go
- Asking "What's next on checklist?"
- Discussing checklist with partner

**Warning Signs:**
- Checklist created but not open/visible
- No tasks marked complete after 10 minutes
- Participant seems lost despite having checklist
- Checklist too vague ("Implement service" - no subtasks)

## Conclusion

Task-based design integration is complete and ready for workshop delivery. The implementation follows Normal Approach #1 (Simple Introduction + Practice Model) and adds only 5 minutes to the workshop while significantly enhancing the learning experience for complex, multi-step development tasks.

All materials are comprehensive, tested, and aligned with the existing workshop structure. Facilitators have full support through introduction scripts, facilitation notes, and troubleshooting guides.

**Workshop is ready to deliver with task-based design integration! 🎉**
