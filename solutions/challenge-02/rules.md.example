# Project Coding Standards

## Method Length
- All methods must be under 20 lines of code
- If a method exceeds 20 lines, extract helper methods
- Break complex logic into smaller, focused methods
- Count only executable lines (not comments or blank lines)

## Documentation
- All public methods must have Javadoc comments
- Include @param tags for all parameters with descriptions
- Include @return tag for non-void methods
- Include @throws tag for checked exceptions
- Describe what the method does, not how it does it
- Keep Javadoc concise but complete

## Encapsulation
- No public fields (except public static final constants)
- All instance fields must be private
- Provide public getters/setters only when truly needed
- Validate inputs in all setters
- Consider immutability - use final where possible

## Naming Conventions (Google Java Style Guide)
- Class names: PascalCase (InventoryManager)
- Method names: camelCase starting with verb (addItem, calculateTotal)
- Variable names: camelCase (itemName, totalValue)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (MAX_ITEMS, DEFAULT_QUANTITY)
- No abbreviations: calc → calculateTotalValue, getAll → getAllItems
- Boolean variables/methods: isValid, hasItems, canProcess
- Collections: plural names (items, quantities, prices)

## Dependency Injection
- Use constructor injection for required dependencies
- Avoid field injection
- Make injected dependencies final
- Keep constructors simple (just assignment, no logic)

## Logging
- Never use System.out.println in production code
- Use java.util.logging.Logger or SLF4J
- Create logger: `private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(ClassName.class.getName());`
- Log at appropriate levels:
  - SEVERE: errors and exceptions
  - WARNING: potential problems
  - INFO: significant operations
  - FINE/FINER: debugging details

## Validation
- Validate all inputs in public methods
- Throw IllegalArgumentException for invalid inputs
- Provide clear, specific error messages
- Validate at API boundaries, trust internal calls

## Single Responsibility Principle
- Each class should have one reason to change
- Each method should do one thing well
- Extract helper methods for complex operations
- Avoid methods with multiple responsibilities

## Error Handling
- Don't catch exceptions unless you can handle them meaningfully
- Don't swallow exceptions silently
- Log errors before re-throwing
- Provide context in exception messages

## Code Organization
- Order: constants → fields → constructors → public methods → private methods
- Group related methods together
- Keep related helper methods near their callers
- Separate concerns with blank lines and comments
